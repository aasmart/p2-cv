# UMich EECS280 Project 2: Computer Vision
This project was done for my EECS280 class at the University of Michigan. The project specs can be found [here](https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/)

### If you are an EECS280 student at Umich, you should not steal any code from this repository. The risk of being caught cheating outways the short-term benefits of stealing code. Instead, use this as a learning source to write your own code and implement your own test cases.
